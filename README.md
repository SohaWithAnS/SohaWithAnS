Hi, I’m Soha 🌸

- 😊 I’m a CS graduate student.
- 👩🏽‍💻 I'm currently learning how to use Python with Selenium for a fun automation hobby-project :]  
- 🌱 I'm currently listening to **Bad Feminist** by **Roxane Gay**.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects involving using tech for social good, HealthTech, Art + Tech, FinTech. 
     I'm open to other intersections with tech as well :)
